        <h2>Using a shift register</h2>
        
        <h3>Information</h3>
        In the last lab, you used the Raspberry Pi's General Purpose Input/Output pins for both input and output. For input, your code checked to see if any of 4 buttons were pressed. For output, your code turned on up to 8 LEDs. Each of these buttons and LEDs are connected to an individual GPIO pin. However, direct connections like this are actually an inefficient method of connecting devices to the Pi. Why? Look at this pin diagram from <a href="https://pinout.xyz">pinout.xyz</a>:
        <img src="https://pinout.xyz/resources/raspberry-pi-pinout.png">
        Some of these pins have special functions that others do not have:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver/transmitter">UART</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. The old school way of communicating to other devices. With the right adapter, it can connect to RS-232 devices that can either access the PI's console or allow the PI to access the console of, say, a Cisco switch.</li>
                <li>BCM 14 is the UART Tx line</li>
                <li>BCM 15 is the UART Rx line</li>
            </ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C">I²C</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Inter-Intergrated Circuit, which is supposed to be written as I²C, but is often written as I2C since super scripts are too hard. The abbrivation is actually pronounced as "I-squared-C" so don't call it "I-two-C" if you don't want to be made fun of behind your back! The PI has two I²C channels (0 and 1).</li>
                <li>BCM 2 is the Serial Data line (SDA) for channel 1</li>
                <li>BCM 3 is the Serial Clock line (SCL) for channel 1</li>
                <li>BCM 0 is the Serial Data line (SDA) for channel 0</li>
                <li>BCM 1 is the Serial Clock line (SCL) for channel 0</li>
                <li><i>Note:</i> The HAT breaks out the I²C channel 1 lines, but the channel 0 lines are connected to the EEPROM chip below the buttons, next to the camera slot.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus">SPI</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Serial Peripheral Interface. The PI has two SPI channels (0 and 1), but you have to chose your own chip select pin for channel 1.</li>
                <li>BCM 10 is the Master Out Slave In (MOSI) line for channel 0</li>
                <li>BCM 9 is the Master In Slave Out (MISO) line for channel 0</li>
                <li>BCM 10 is the Serial Clock (SCLK) line for channel 0</li>
                <li>BCM 8 is the Chip Enable 0 (CE0) line for channel 0</li>
                <li>BCM 7 is the Chip Enable 1 (CE1) line for channel 0</li>
                <li>BCM 20 is the Master Out Slave In (MOSI) line for channel 1</li>
                <li>BCM 19 is the Master In Slave Out (MISO) line for channel 1</li>
                <li>BCM 21 is the Serial Clock (SCLK) line for channel 1</li>
                <li><i>Note:</i> Can use another GPIO pin as another Chip Enable pin, but your code has to be written a little differently.</li>
                <li><i>Note:</i> The HAT only breaks out the channel 0 pins. Channel 1 MOSI is used for Switch 2, Channel 1 SCLK is used for Switch 3, and Channel 1 MISO is used for LED2.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire">1-Wire</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The 1-Wire interface uses 1 wire for communication, if that wasn't obvious.</li>
                <li>BCM 4 is the Data line.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
        The HAT was designed to breakout these special connections so that <i>someone</i> (hint, hint) could more easily use them to extend the functionality of the HAT and build a neat project. These special lines can also be used as normal GPIO pins, but access to that special feature is lost. Because we're saving those pins for their special use, there aren't a lot of options to add more functionality to the HAT. So, how many pins do we still have to work with? We know that the PI 2 (and newer) has 40 pins. Let's count the specialized pins, pins for the LEDs, pins for the buttons, pins for power and ground:
        <ul>
            <li>8 LEDs</li>
            <li>4 Buttons</li>
            <li>2 UART lines</li>
            <li>4 I²C lines (2 channels)</li>
            <li>5 SPI lines (channel 0 only, remember that the channel 1 pins were used for buttons or LEDs)</li>
            <li>1 1-Wire line</li>
            <li>2 5 volt power lines</li>
            <li>2 3.3 volt power lines</li>
            <li>8 Ground lines</li>
        </ul>
        So, do some fifth grade math and figure out how many pins are left. Alright, fine, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=40+-+(8%2B4%2B2%2B4%2B5%2B1%2B2%2B2%2B8)">I'll do it for you</a>: there are 4 pins available.</br></br>
        
        Now, look at your HAT. Look at the 7 segment display. How many LEDs in the display are there? 8: the 7 segments of the digit and the decimal point. We only have 4 pins to drive 8 LEDs. How would we accomplish this? We use a shift register!</br></br>
        
        <i>What's a shift register?</i></br>
        It is a register that you shift bits into!</br></br>
        
        Alright, fine a more detailed explanation: a shift register is an integrated circuit that allows a microcontroller or other device to expand input or output by reading or writing data in serial. They take data one bit at a time, store it in a register, and shift the existing values over over.</br></br>
        
        The HAT uses a <code>74HC595N</code> shift register, the black package next to the seven segment display. It requires at least 3 lines to drive: <code>data</code>, <code>clock</code>, and <code>latch</code>. There are an optional 2 lines that can be used: <code>output enable</code> and <code>clear register</code>. If these aren't used, tie <code>output enable</code> to ground and <code>clear register</code> to 5v. It can be daisy chained to more shift registers, allowing for an arbitrary number of extra pins. The HAT doesn't use the two optional lines, since we only have 4 pins available and it would be more complicated to program. Review the schematic for the 7 segment display functional area of the HAT:

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the <code>7seg.py</code> code from the Resources section. Run it and use <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> when you're ready for the next step.</li>
            <li>Open the code in <code>nano</code> to analyze it.</li> 
			<li>Understanding the code:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The shift register only needs 3 pins: <code>data</code>, <code>clock</code>, and <code>latch</code>. We'll use BCM 17 for <code>data</code>, BCM 27 for <code>clock</code>, and BCM 22 for <code>latch</code>.</li>
                <pre><code class="python">#Pins for shift register
dataPin = 17
clockPin = 27
latchPin = 22</code></pre>
                <li>Next is an array full of hexidecimal values. We use this so that we can just call <code>segments[]</code> to display a certain digit on the 7 segment display and not need to remember what bits need to be shifted out to the register.</li>
                <li>But, how do we know which values will display which character? Simple: the schematic and binary. This is the relevant part of the schematic:</li>
                <img src="../images/4/sch.2.png">
                <li>According to the schematic above, the following pins on the shift register map to the LEDs in the seven segment display:</li>

                </table>
                <li>With the above chart, we know which shift register pins we need to turn on to turn on a given display segment. Next, we need to know which <i>segments</i> we need to turn on to show the digit we want. To do that, let's work out how to display the character <code>0</code>. We'll use <code>0</code> to represent <code>OFF</code> and <code>1</code> to represent <code>ON</code>:</li>

                <li>Decimal is great and all, but sometimes even decimal numbers start to get out of hand, so let's convert our binary number into a hexidecimal number by using the following chart:</li>

                <li>Now, look at your code, at the first value in the array created:</li>
                <pre><code class="python">segments = [0xFC, 0x60, 0xDA, 0xF2, 0x66, 0xB6, 0x3E, 0xE0, 0xFE, 0xF6]</code></pre>
                <li>See the <code>0xFC</code>? Looks familar, doesn't it? Try doing the process we just did to find out what the rest of the values will display.</li></br>

					</div>
				</div>
				
				<li>Before looking at the code to output this number, we need to understand <i>what</i> we actually have to do:</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Get a single bit of the number we want.</li>
					<li>Turn the GPIO pin connected to the shift register's <code>data</code> pin off if that bit is <code>0</code> or on if it is <code>1</code>. This will tell the shift register what number we want to shift into the registers.</li>
					<li>Toggle the GPIO pin connected to the shift register's <code>clock</code> pin on and off. This tells the shift register to take the value on the <code>data</code> pin (<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>) and shift it into the register. <b>The shift register will not change the values in the register until this pin is toggled!</b></li>
					<li>Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 until all of our bits have been shifted out.</li>
					<li>Toggle the GPIO pin connected the the shift register's <code>latch</code> pin on and off. This tells the shift register to take the values in the storage register and put them in the output register, to actually output them. This line <i>could</i> be tied to the to the 5v line to always immediately show the bit shifted in, but this means that the wrong output could occur on each pin. In a seven segment display, this may manifest as a flickering. In other, more reactive components could result in... <i>unwanted</i> action.</li>
				</ol>


				<li>We know what we need to do now. So, how do we get a single bit of <code>0xFC</code> at a time? The schematic and bitwise operations! What's a bitwise operation? It is an operation that acts on the actual bits that make up the number in memory. This is low level manipulation of values!</li>
				
				<li>Python suppports the following bitwise operations:</li>

                    <li><code>== 1</code> checks if the result of the above is equal to 1 and returns <code>True</code> if it is. <i>Note:</i> some languages can implicitly convert one type of value to another.

                    <li><code>GPIO.output(dataPin, ...)</code> takes the results of the above, which by now would either be <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> and turns the pin on if it was <code>True</code> or off if it was <code>False</code></li>

                <li>The section directly under the <code>if:</code> does something similar to the <code>else:</code> section, but it reads from MSB to LSB instead. Read the code and see if you understand it.</li>
                <li>This is the final line of our function. If there was a value to return, it would follow the return statement. However, we don't need to return anything, so we just need to return to where the function was called from.</li>

                <li>In this loop, we finally use our function that we just spent previous part of the lab trying to understand.

                <li>Next, we toggle our latch on and off to tell the shift register to output the value we just shifted to it and we wait a short amount of time before sending out the next value.</li>

						A pro of shift registers is that they expand your input or output capabilities. However, they have two major cons: they require more complex code to use (see this entire lab) and they will slow your code's execution speed (look at all the code used here compared to that used in lab 3. Both are used to turn on or off the same number of LEDs).

            <li>Now that we finally, <i>finally</i> understand how to use a shift register, try do the following:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>See if you actually need to use <code>==</code> in <code>GPIO.output(dataPin, ((mask & output) >> c) == 1)</code></li>
                <li>Find the hexidecimal values needed to display the following characters to the display: <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, <code>E</code>, <code>F</code>.</li>
                <li>Use the original values given to you and the values you calculated above and show them, one character at a time, on the display.</li>
