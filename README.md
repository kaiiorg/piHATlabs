#PI HAT Labs
These are labs for a HAT originally designed as part of an independent study for Southeast Missouri State Universities' Department of Polytechnic Studies. It is designed for basic learning of Raspberry PI GPIO programming, using LEDs, switches, and a shift register with a seven segment display. The board also has additional headers on the various communications buses of the PI, to make it slightly easier to expand the hat while still using the components it supplies.

**_Snark Warning:_** If you think your students are special little snow flakes that need to be protected or take offense at every little thing, I suggest you don't bother reading the rest of this or consider deploying these labs to your students. I wrote these labs in a manner that I would have wanted: not boring or bland, with lots of useful information, with an occasional poke or prod to keep things interesting. This is written for _actual_ university level students. Freshman and sophomore level students, sure, but university students. Emailing me about the level of snark in these labs will only get you ignored.

##Instructors: Supply Your Students With These Materials:
1. A Raspberry Pi 2 or newer
2. A USB AC power adapter
3. An HDMI cable (or a cable that is HDMI -> whatever your lab's monitors support)
4. USB Mouse
5. USB Keyboard
6. Ethernet Cable
7. Network access to access these labs via web browser. Internet access required for some elements to load correctly.
8. Access to a Windows (7 to 10 should work) computer for the first lab, the other labs can be completed entirely on the PI.

##Lab 1: Install Rasbian on a Raspberry PI
Students learn to install the Rasbian OS onto a Raspberry PI. They will need access to a Windows computer for this part.
**_Instructors:_ Read the bottom of lab 1! You will need to manually download the Raspbian image and follow the directions there.**

##Lab 2: Test the HAT
Students learn about the physical layout of the HAT and run their first python program. This program tests all the components for functionality.

##Lab 3: GPIO Input and Output
Students learn basic electrical schematic elements and the electrical schematic of the HAT. They learn to turn the LEDs on or off and how that code works. They learn how to read input from the buttons and how that code works.

##Lab 4: Using a shift register
Students learn a little bit of binary, binary to decimal conversion, binary to hexidecimal conversion, how a shift register works, how to *use* a shift register
